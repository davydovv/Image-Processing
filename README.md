# Image Processing
This is a basic set of getting and analysing image characteristics. All functions are implemented in C++. 

1) Loading and saving bmp image;

2) Extracting any component (R, G and B);

3) Converting RGB to YCbCr;

4) Extracting any component (Y, Cb and Cr);

5) Calculating PSNR;

6) Calculating correlation between image components;

7) Component decimation (by dublication & by average);

8) Image mirror reflection (horisontal & vertical);

9) Image rotating;

10) Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (DPCM).
